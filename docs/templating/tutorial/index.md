# Templating Tutorial - Getting Started
This tutorial will try to enable you to write your own templates or modify
one of the examples to your needs.
On this page we develop a basic template for Peering Manager.
If you want to dive in further - see the other parts.

Templates are highly individual to each network, so there is no
"one size fits all".

The purpose of a template is to translate information stored in Peering Manager
into a syntactically and semantically correct router configuration.

There are several design decisions you must take when writing your own template:

1. What to put into the template and what to keep out of it.
Sounds trivial, but a router configuration can be complex.
Roughly, there are two ways to approach this:
    - Self contained template: There are no references from the template to
    the "outside" of it.
    Means that all policies, route maps, lists, etc. referenced in the template
    are also defined in the template.
    This does not mean that there is no configuration on the router(s)
    themselves - just no reference from inside the template to it.
    - Template with outside references: Things that rarely change like community
    lists, route-maps are kept out of the template and configured on the router.
    The template simply refers to them where needed.
2. Which part(s) of Peering Manager to use: You might not need all features of
Peering Manager in your template.
For example, I did not use BGP Groups.
You might only use it to configure BGP sessions and leave all Communities or
Policies out.
Its all up to you.

This tutorial will give you the building blocks of templates.
The actual design and build you must do yourself according to your needs.

We are building the template step by step from the beginning. The following
syntax is used in this document:

!!! todo
    This marks tasks you need to do using the web interface of Peering Manager

```
This goes into your template.
Don't worry - the complete template we are building will be listed at the end.
```


## Building an example template
Peering Manager should manage your peerings - well, it's in the name.
So the template suggested here takes care of:

* No conflict with existing configurations on your router(s).
* Adding new peerings: When a peering request comes in, you only will have to
select the AS and IXP where to peer.
Rest is done automatically, including:
    * Building and attaching prefix filters (if wanted)
    * Setting communities incoming (and outgoing)
    * Building a _route-map_ or _route-policy_ or what ever your platform
    supports for filtering receiving and announcing prefixes.

To achieve these goals lets set a few variables at the beginning of your
template - we are prepending every configuration item in our router by a
specific string to make sure nothing is overwritten what is already there.

```
{#- To avoid conflict with prefedined elements,
we prepend everything we define#}
{%- set p="pm-"%}
```

We also put the platform of the template into a variable so we can refer to it
in the template:

=== "Cisco IOS"
    ```
    {#- We define the type of template for reference #}
    {%- set template_type="cisco-ios"%}
    ```

=== "Cisco IOS XR"
    ```
    {#- We define the type of template for reference #}
    {%- set template_type="cisco-iosxr"%}
    ```

=== "Juniper"
    ```
    {#- We define the type of template for reference #}
    {%- set template_type="juniper-junos"%}
    ```


## Platform specialities
All platforms are different and some platforms lack certain features.
Peering Manager itself is platform independent.
That does not mean that everything you configure inside Peering Manager can be 
rolled out to every platform.

This overview here will focus on the limits of the platforms featured in the
examples of this tutorial.

### Cisco IOS XR
The 'modern' Cisco platform.
Lots of features and nearly everything can be put into a template.
One issue to be aware of are the handling of _BGP Communities_
- Peering Manager has only one type of community and you can simply enter a
Large, Extended or Normal value.
Cisco IOS XR handles these three differently, so the template must somehow
find out the type of a community.
This example uses only regular communities, but if you want to use large
communities you must be aware of this.

For policies, it is possible to _apply_ one policy inside another, so all
configured policies in Peering Manager can go one-to-one into the template and a
"session policy" can then call each of them.
To check out if the resulting policy is ok, you can use
```show rpl route-policy _name_ inline``` command.

### Cisco IOS
The 'old' Cisco platform - quite limited in features.
You can attach only _one_ route-map to each BGP session.
So if you have multiple policies applied to various elements,
they need to be "flattened" into one route-map.
The suggestion here is to keep things simple and try not to use
too many features.
Also be aware of the ordering of statements, if in doubt,
check the configuration produced before you apply it.


## Configuration design
For all configs the following design decisions are applied:

* We distinguish between three types of eBGP sessions:
    * Customers
    * Peers
    * Transit
* The policy for announcing prefixes is as follows:
    * Customer prefixes are announced to customers, peers, transit (= all)
    * Peer prefixes are announced to customers (only)
    * Transit prefixes are announced to customers (only)
* When receiving prefixes, _BGP Communities_ are **set** that control where
these prefixes are announced
* When announcing prefixes, existing BGP communities are **checked**, and either
announced or not
* The template developed here takes only care of peers, however, you can easily
extend it to handle transit and customers as well.

## BGP Communities

The following communities are used in this example:

| Announce to | Community            |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Nobody      | 65500:40000 or empty |
| Customers   | 65500:41000          |
| Peers       | 65500:42000          |
| Transit     | 65500:44000          |

If want to combine them, simply set two or more communities.

!!! question
    Why these numbers?
    I have been using them for years and simply copied them from my router.
    Cisco allows _regular expression parsing_ of communities and the '4' as the
    first digit in my case means 'control announcement'.

!!! todo
    Define the communities listed above in Peering Manager.
    Give them meaningful names like "Announce to Customers"
    and set their type to **ingress** (as they are _set_ when receiving prefixes).

Now with the communities defined, we need to put code into our template to
generate the configuration statements.

We also build a "delete list" of all communities we are using internally so we
can delete them from received prefixes.

=== "Cisco IOS"
    ```
    !
    ! Communitiy Lists
    !
    {#- Generate named lists for all communities #}
    {%- for community in communities %}
    ip community-list standard {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} permit {{community.value}}
    ip community-list standard {{p}}comm-delete permit {{community.value}}
    {%-endfor%}
    !
    ```

    Output for our example looks like:
    ```
    !
    ! Communitiy Lists
    !
    ip community-list standard pm-announce-to-nobody-ingress permit 65500:40000
    ip community-list standard pm-announce-to-customers-ingress permit 65500:41000
    ip community-list standard pm-announce-to-peers-ingress permit 65500:42000
    ip community-list standard pm-announce-to-upstream-ingress permit 65500:44000
    !
    ip community-list standard pm-comm-delete permit 65500:40000
    ip community-list standard pm-comm-delete permit 65500:41000
    ip community-list standard pm-comm-delete permit 65500:42000
    ip community-list standard pm-comm-delete permit 65500:44000
    ```


=== "Cisco IOS XR"
    ```
    !
    ! Communitiy Lists
    !
    {#- Generate named lists for all communities #}
    {%- for community in communities %}
    !
    community-set {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}}
      {{community.value}}
    end-set
    {%-endfor%}
    !
    ```

=== "Juniper"
    ```
    #
    #  Community Lists
    #
    {#- Generate named lists for all communities #}
    policy-options {
    {%- for community in communities %}
      community {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} members [ {{community.value}} ];
    {%-endfor%}
      community {{p}}comm-delete members [
    {%- for community in communities %}
      {{community.value}}
    {%-endfor%}
      ];
    }
    ```


!!! remark
    In practise on a modern router we would use _Large Communities_.
    But as some old routers still do not support them, we stick with
    regular communities for this example.

With the communities defined, we now need to apply them to ASes or IXPs.
If you only peer at an IXP (have no transit or cusomer relationships) you can only
apply them to the IXP, no need to also apply them to every AS.

!!! todo
    Have an IXP configured in Peering Manager, and apply the "Announcd to
    Customers" community as _ingress_ BGP community.

## Prefix filtering
Peering Manager uses [bgpq3](http://snar.spb.ru/prog/bgpq3/) to build prefix
filters.
You might not want that for every peer, especially if you peer with a
route server who, like the DE-CIX route servers, [already
filter](https://www.de-cix.net/en/locations/frankfurt/route-server-guide).

To enable filtering for a peering AS, we use a _tag_.

!!! todo
    Create a _tag_ in peering manager and give it a name like "Filter Prefixes"

=== "Cisco IOS"
    In IOS we have to handle IPv4 and IPv6 separately.
    We create two _prefix lists_ which we later attach to the
    peering session(s) for tagged ASes.
    In case we do not want to filter we also create a prefix list allowing
    everything - this makes the templating for the BGP session easier.

    ```
    {%- for as in autonomous_systems %}
      {%- for tag in as.tags.all() if tag.slug == "filter-prefixes" and as.prefixes %}
      {#- If you want prefix filtering for an as, apply a tag  #}
    !
    ! Prefix-lists for AS{{as.asn}} - {{as.name}}
    !
        {%- for thisprefix in as.prefixes.ipv4 %}
    ip prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} permit {{thisprefix.prefix}}
          {%- if not thisprefix.exact %} le {{thisprefix['less-equal']}}{%-endif%}
        {%- endfor %}
    !
        {%- for thisprefix in as.prefixes.ipv6 %}
    ipv6 prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} permit {{thisprefix.prefix}}
          {%- if not thisprefix.exact %} le {{thisprefix['less-equal']}}{%-endif%}
        {%- endfor %}
    !
      {%-else%}
      {#- no filtering #}
    ip prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} permit 0.0.0.0/0 le 32
    ipv6 prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} permit ::0/0 le 128
    !
      {%-endfor%}
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

    This is later attached to the BGP session like this:
    ```
    ...
      neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} in
    ...
    ```

=== "Cisco IOS XR"
    IOS XR has _prefix sets_ in which you can mix IPv4 and IPv6 prefixes.
    This makes template writing easier.
    Also, we create a _route-policy_ to check the prefixes and if filtering is
    not wanted we simply do a policy containing
    only a _pass_ statement (allowing all).

    ```
    {%- for as in autonomous_systems %}
      {%- for tag in as.tags.all() if tag.slug == "filter-prefixes" and as.prefixes %}
    !
    ! Prefix-list for AS{{as.asn}} - {{as.name}}
    !
    prefix-set {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}}
      # AS{{as.asn}} - {{as.name}}
        {%- for thisprefix in as.prefixes.ipv4+as.prefixes.ipv6 %}
      {{thisprefix.prefix}}
      {%- if not thisprefix.exact %} le {{thisprefix['less-equal']}}{%-endif%}
      {%- if not loop.last%},{%-endif%}
        {%- endfor %}
    end-set
    !
    route-policy {{p}}prefixes-from-as{{as.asn}}
      # AS{{as.asn}} - {{as.name}}
      if destination in {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}} then
        pass
      else
        drop
      endif
    end-policy
    !
      {%-else%}
      {#- Delete old set if still exists #}
    no prefix-set {{p}}from-as{{as.asn}}
      {#- Generate an empty policy if no filtering is wanted so the reference still works #}
    route-policy {{p}}prefixes-from-as{{as.asn}}
      pass
    end-policy
    !
      {%-endfor %}
    {%-endfor %}
    ```


## Routing Policies
With Communities and Prefix Lists/Sets in place, we can now define some routing
policies and that part of the template which converts them into router
configurations.

Here we really have to be very platform specific.
In some platforms like IOS XR the template looks very short and easy to
understand, while for others like old Cisco IOS we have to make some compromises.

Inside Peering Manager a policy is simply a piece of JSON - but that allows us
to put code for multiple platforms into it.

!!! todo
    Add a _Routing Policy_ in Peering Manager with a name like "peering-out".
    Define it as an _Export_ policy and put the follwing JSON into the _Config
    Context_:
    ```JSON
    {
    "cisco-ios": [
        {
            "match": [
                "community pm-announce-to-peers-ingress"
            ],
            "result": "permit"
        }
    ],
    "cisco-iosxr": [
        "if community matches-any pm-announce-to-peers-ingress then",
        "  pass",
        "else",
        "  drop",
        "endif"
    ]
    }
    ```
Using this format allows to put policies for more than one platform into the
config context.
Of course, if you only have one router platform you can rewrite this to your
needs.

We have to do the same for incoming.

!!! todo
    Add a _Routing Policy_ in Peering Manage and name it like "peering-in".
    Define it as an _Import_ policy and put the following JSON into the _Config
    Context_:
    ```JSON
    {
    "cisco-ios": [
        {
            "set": [
                "local-preference 1000"
            ],
            "result": "permit"
        }
    ],
    "cisco-iosxr": [
        "set local-preference 1000",
        "pass"
    ]
    }
    ```

Now we define templates for the different platforms.

=== "Cisco IOS"
    In IOS we can apply _one_ route-map to each BGP session.
    So we iterate over all IXPs and all enabled IXP sessions and generate
    route-maps (one for in, one for out).

    Peering Managers filter ```merge_import_policies``` does the work of putting
    all the policies (of IXPs, ASes, and sessions) together, see the
    documentation for how this is done.

    We have to generate one route-map for all policies defined.

    - We put an explicit _deny_ clause at the end, as there is no implicit deny
    when "continue" is used.
    - For incoming, we first delete all our own communities and use a _continue_
    statement to go on
    - Then we add all IXP communities, and also _continue_
        - Unfortunately there is no easy way to add AS communities (yet)
    - Then we add all defined policies, one by one:
        - "result" goes into the header of the route-map clause
        - "set" and "match" statements are simply printed out
        - numbering is done automatically, iteration of the outer loop
        multiplied by 1000

    ```
    {%- for ixp in internet_exchange_points %}
      {%- for session in ixp |  sessions %}
        {%- if session.enabled %}
    ! Session with AS{{session.autonomous_system.asn}} ID:{{ session.id }} at {{ixp.name}}
    ! Put "deny" clause at the end
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in deny 65535
    ! Delete all our own communities incoming at the beginning
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in permit 1
      set comm-list {{p}}comm-delete delete
      continue
    !
    ! Then set all required communities for this IXP using continue
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in permit 2
          {%-for community in ixp.communities.all() %}
            {%-if community.type == "ingress"%}
      set community {{community.value}} additive
            {%-endif%}
          {%-endfor%}
      continue
    ! Then put all the rest "flattened" into clauses
    ! In: {{session | merge_import_policies |  iterate('slug') | join(',') }}
          {%-for policy in session | merge_import_policies%}
            {%-set outer=loop.index%}
            {%- if policy.config_context is iterable %}
              {%- for part in policy.config_context %}
                {%- if part == template_type%}
                  {%- for statement in policy.config_context[part] %}
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in {{statement.result}} {{outer*1000+loop.index}}
                    {%-for inner in statement.match%}
      match {{inner}}
                    {%-endfor%}
                    {%-for inner in statement.set%}
      set {{inner}}
                    {%-endfor%}
                  {%-endfor%}
                {%-endif%}
              {%-endfor%}
            {%-endif%}
          {%-endfor%}
    !
    ! End of IN
    !
    ! Same for Out: "deny" clause at the end
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out deny 65535
    ! Set communities at the beginning
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out permit 1
          {%-for community in ixp.communities.all() %}
            {%-if community.type == "egress"%}
      set community {{community.value}} additive
            {%-endif%}
          {%-endfor%}
      continue
    !
          {%-for policy in session | merge_export_policies%}
    ! And all the export policies
    ! Out: {{session | merge_export_policies |  iterate('slug') | join(',') }}

            {%-set outer=loop.index%}
            {%- if policy.config_context is iterable %}
              {%- for part in policy.config_context %}
                {%- if part == template_type%}
                  {%- for statement in policy.config_context[part] %}
    route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out {{statement.result}} {{outer*1000+loop.index}}
                    {%-for inner in statement.match%}
      match {{inner}}
                    {%-endfor%}
                    {%-for inner in statement.set%}
      set {{inner}}
                    {%-endfor%}
                  {%-endfor%}
                {%-endif%}
              {%-endfor%}
            {%-endif%}
          {%-endfor%}
        {%-endif%}
      {%-endfor%}
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

=== "Cisco IOS XR"
    IOS XR allows that route-policies can be _applied_
    (called, like a subroutine) inside policies.
    That allows us to generate separate policies for all elements:

    - Export routing policies defined in Peering Manager
    - Create ingress and egress policies for ASes
    - Create ingress and egress policies for IXPs
    - Create ingress and egress policies for IXP sessions.
    These also call all other ones and will be attached to the BGP session.
    - In this example we will skip direct sessions and BGP Groups,
    but policies can be created here as well.

    The IOS XR template to create all configured policies looks like this:

    ```
    !
    ! Configured Policies
    !
    {%- for policy in routing_policies %}
    !
    route-policy {{p}}{{policy.name}}
      {%- if policy.config_context is iterable %}
        {%- for part in policy.config_context %}
          {%- if part == template_type%}
            {%- for statement in policy.config_context[part] %}
     {#- Simply dump all statements one after another#}
     {{statement}}
            {%-endfor%}
          {%-endif%}
        {%-endfor%}
      {%-endif%}
    end-policy
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

    For AS policies we also apply communities if there are any configured for
    an AS.
    This has to be done last, so it is not removed by the applied policies.
    Also, the policy which checks the incoming prefixes
    (or lets every prefix in) is applied.

    ```
    !
    ! Route Policies for  AS{{as.asn}}
    !
    {#- Here the order of statements is important - adding communities is last so they do not get removed by a policy #}
    route-policy {{p}}as-{{as.asn}}-in
      # {{as.name}}
      apply {{p}}prefixes-from-as{{as.asn}}
      {%- for policy in as | iter_import_policies()%}
      apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
      {%-endfor%}
      {%-for community in as.communities.all()%}
        {%- if community.type == "ingress" %}
      set community {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} additive
        {%-endif%}
      {%-endfor%}
      pass
    end-policy
    !
    route-policy {{p}}as-{{as.asn}}-out
      # {{as.name}}
    {%- for policy in as | iter_export_policies()%}
      apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
    {%-endfor%}
    {%-for community in as.communities.all()%}
      {%- if community.type == "egress" %}
    set community {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} additive
      {%-endif%}
    {%-endfor%}
      pass
    end-policy
    !
    {%- endfor %}
    ```
    The output of this part of the template looks like this:
    ```
    !
    ! Route Policies for  AS61438
    !
    route-policy pm-as-61438-in
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      apply pm-prefixes-from-as61438
      set community pm-announce-to-customers-ingress additive
      pass
    end-policy
    !
    route-policy pm-as-61438-out
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      pass
    end-policy
    !
    ```

    The next policies exported are IXP policies, again we also add communities:
    ```
    !
    ! Route Policies for IXP {{ixp.name}}
    !
    route-policy {{p}}ix-{{ixp.slug}}-in
     # {{ixp.name}}
     {%- for policy in ixp | iter_import_policies()%}
     apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
     {%-endfor%}
     {%-for community in ixp.communities.all()%}
       {%- if community.type == "ingress" %}
     set community {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} additive
       {%-endif%}
     {%-endfor%}
     pass
    end-policy
    !
    route-policy {{p}}ix-{{ixp.slug}}-out
     # {{ixp.name}}
     {%- for policy in ixp | iter_export_policies()%}
     apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
     {%-endfor%}
     {%-for community in ixp.communities.all()%}
      {%- if community.type == "egress" %}
     set community {{p}}{{community.slug}}-{{community.type}} additive
      {%-endif%}
     {%-endfor%}
     pass
    end-policy
    !
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

    None of them will be directly attached to any BGP session.
    As policies can also defined on a per-session basis,
    we generate session-policies which then will apply all the
    previously generated:
    ```
    !
    ! IXP Session Policies
    !
    {%- for ixp in internet_exchange_points %}
      {%- for session in ixp | sessions %}
        {%- if session.enabled %}
    ! Session with AS{{session.autonomous_system.asn}} ID:{{ session.id }} at {{ixp.name}}
    route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in
      # {{session.autonomous_system.name}}
      apply {{p}}ix-{{ixp.slug}}-in
      apply {{p}}as-{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-in
      {%- for policy in session | iter_import_policies()%}
      apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
      {%-endfor%}
    end-policy
    !
    route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out
      # {{session.autonomous_system.name}}
      apply {{p}}ix-{{ixp.slug}}-out
      apply {{p}}as-{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-out
      {%- for policy in session | iter_export_policies()%}
      apply {{p}}{{policy.name}}
      {%-endfor%}
    end-policy
    !
        {%-else%}
        {#- Session is disabled, remove route policy as well #}
    no route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in
    no route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out
        {%-endif%}
      {%-endfor%}
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

    Please note the order in which policies are applied
    (this is open for dicussion, feel free to change in your template):

    1. IXP policy
    2. AS policy
    3. Session policy

    An exported session policy looks like
    (in this case there is no session policy applied):
    ```
    ! Session with AS61438 ID:54 at DE-CIX Frankfurt
    route-policy pm-session-as61438-id54-in
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      apply pm-ix-de-cix-frankfurt-in
      apply pm-as-61438-in
    end-policy
    !
    route-policy pm-session-as61438-id54-out
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      apply pm-ix-de-cix-frankfurt-out
      apply pm-as-61438-out
    end-policy
    !
    ```

    You now might ask where the actual checking of what is announced
    takes place as you do not want to flood your peers.
    For this, Cisco IOS XR has a command
    ```show rpl route-policy <name> inline```,
    applied to the policy above it shows:

    ```
    route-policy pm-session-as61438-id54-out
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      # apply pm-as-61438-out
      # ip-it consult GmbH
      pass
      # end-apply pm-as-61438-out
      # apply pm-ix-de-cix-frankfurt-out
      # DE-CIX Frankfurt
      # apply pm-peering-out
      if community matches-any (65500:42000) then
        pass
      else
        drop
      endif
      # end-apply pm-peering-out
      pass
      # end-apply pm-ix-de-cix-frankfurt-out
    end-policy
    ```
    So if the community for exporting to peers (65500:42000) is not set,
    policy _pm-peering-out_ takes care that the announcement is dropped.

## BGP Sessions
At last we now create the template for the IXP BGP sessions
(direct sessions are not hanled in this tutorial).

We again loop over all IXPs and all sessions at this IXP and create
peer entries for both IPv4 and IPv6.

=== "Cisco IOS"
    Compared to creating the policies this looks rather simple.
    We add route-maps we have generated above in and out.
    The prefix-list is also applied.
    In case the session is disabled the neighbor is removed
    (alternatively the session can be shut, this is up to you to code).

    ```
    router bgp {{ local_as.asn }}
      no bgp enforce-first-as
    {%- for ixp in internet_exchange_points %}
      {%- for session in ixp |  sessions %}
        {%- if session.enabled %}
        ! AS{{ session.autonomous_system.asn }} - {{ session.autonomous_system.name | safe_string }}
        neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} remote-as {{ session.autonomous_system.asn }}
        neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} description {{ session.autonomous_system.name | safe_string }}
        {%- if session.encrypted_password %}
        neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} password encrypted {{ session.encrypted_password | cisco_password }}
        {%- elif session.password %}
        neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} password clear {{ session.password }}
        {%- endif %}
        address-family ipv{{ session | ip_version }} unicast
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} activate
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in in
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} route-map {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out out
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} prefix-list {{p}}from-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}} in
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} send-community both
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} remove-private-as
            {%- if session | max_prefix %}
          neighbor {{ session.ip_address }} maximum-prefix {{ session | max_prefix }} 95
            {%- endif %}
        exit-address-family
        {%- else %}
       no neighbor {{ session.ip_address }}
        {%-endif%}
      {%-endfor%}
    {%-endfor%}
    ```

    Output of one entry looks like this:
    ```
    ! AS61438 - ip-it consult GmbH
    neighbor 80.81.194.176 remote-as 61438
    neighbor 80.81.194.176 description ip-it consult GmbH

    exit-address-family

=== "Cisco IOS XR"
    Compared to creating the policies this looks rather simple.
    We add route-maps we have generated above in and out.
    In case the session is disabled the neighbor is removed
    (alternatively the session can be shut, this is up to you to code).

    A few things to note here:

    - If you peer with route servers you have to disable
    _enforce-first-as_ globaly, the template makes sure it is re-enabled
    for non route server sessions
    - The prefix filter is already applied in the route-policy
    - If a session is diabled, we remove it.
    Alternatively you can shut it down (coding is up to you).

    ```
    router bgp {{ local_as.asn }}
      bgp enforce-first-as disable
    {%- for ixp in internet_exchange_points %}
      {%- for session in ixp |  sessions %}
        {%- if session.enabled %}
      neighbor {{ session.ip_address }}
         remote-as {{ session.autonomous_system.asn }}
         description {{ session.autonomous_system.name | safe_string }}
          {%- if session.encrypted_password %}
         password encrypted {{ session.encrypted_password | cisco_password }}
          {%- elif session.password %}
         password clear {{ session.password }}
          {%- endif %}
          {%-if session.is_route_server %}
         no enforce-first-as
          {%-else%}
         enforce-first-as
          {%-endif%}
         address-family ipv{{ session | ip_version }} unicast
          route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-in in
          route-policy {{p}}session-as{{session.autonomous_system.asn}}-id{{session.id}}-out out
          send-extended-community-ebgp
          send-community-ebgp
          remove-private-AS
          {%- if session | max_prefix %}
          maximum-prefix {{ session | max_prefix }} 95
          {%- endif %}
        {%- else %}
       no neighbor {{ session.ip_address }}
        {%-endif%}
      {%-endfor%}
    {%-endfor%}

    ```

    Output of one peer looks like:
    ```
