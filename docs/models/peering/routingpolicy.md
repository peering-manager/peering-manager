# Routing Policy

Routing policies are a set of instructions to apply when advertising or
receiving prefixes from another autonomous system. They are meant to filter
routes to import or export. Routing policies play an important role in securing
BGP by rejecting invalid routes. Policies can be chained to achieve complex and
effective filtering, while keeping policies as simple as possible.

## In Peering Manager

Inside Peering Manager, you create routing policies by giving each of them a
name. Policies must already exist on the router as their logic cannot be
defined using Peering Manager. For each routing policy that you create, the
following properties can be configured (n.b. some are optional):

  * `Name`: human-readable name attached to a routing policy.
  * `Slug`: unique configuration and URL friendly name; usually it is
     automatically generated from the routing policy's name.
  * `Type`: when to apply the community on ingress or on egress.
  * `Weight`: a value that defines the order the policies are chained ; the
    policy with the higher value will be evaluated first.
  * `Address Family`: the IP address family the policy can be used for. It can
    be IPv6, IPv4 or both.
  * `Comments`: text to explain what the routing policy is for. Can use
    Markdown formatting.
  * `Tags`: a list of tags to help identifying and searching for a routing
    policy.
