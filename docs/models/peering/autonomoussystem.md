# Autonomous System

An autonomous system, also known as AS, is a collection of connected Internet
Protocol resources managed by network operators. It represents a single
administrative entity which has clearly identified routing policies.

An AS is defined mainly by its number, called the ASN. It is a 32-bit integer
(0 to 4294967295) unique to each autonomous system. Some numbers are reserved
for private use and must not be routed on the Internet.

## In Peering Manager

Inside Peering Manager, you create autonomous systems that you want to peer
with. Your own ASN number must be provided as a setting called `MY_ASN`. For
each AS that you create, the following properties can be configured (n.b. some
are optional):

  * `ASN`: unique autonomous system number of the entity.
  * `Name`: human-readable name attached to an AS.
  * `IRR AS-SET`: the set of other ASNs that can be found behind this AS.
  * `IPv6 Max Prefixes`: a zero or positive integer which defines the maximum
    number of IPv6 prefixes to receive from the AS.
  * `IPv4 Max Prefixes`: a zero or positive integer which defines the maximum
    number of IPv4 prefixes to receive from the AS.
  * `Contact Name`: contact person/team in charge of BGP/peering operations.
  * `Contact Phone`: phone number to get in touch with the contact.
  * `Contact E-mail`: e-mail address to get in touch with the contact.
  * `Import Routing Policies`: a list of routing policies to apply when
     receiving prefixes from the AS.
  * `Export Routing Policies`: a list of routing policies to apply when
     advertising prefixes to the AS.
  * `Properties To Synchronize From PeeringDB`: some properties such as the
    name, the IRR AS-SET and prefix limits can be synchronized from the
    AS' [PeeringDB](https://peeringdb.com/) record.
  * `Tags`: a list of tags to help identifying and searching for an AS.
  * `Comments`: text to record some notes about the AS. Can use Markdown
    formatting.

Note that the best way to keep all of these properties up-to-date is to use the
PeeringDB integration that can synchronize some of them automatically.
