# Contact Roles

Contacts can be organised by functional roles, which are fully customisable by
the user. For example, you might create roles for administrative, operational,
or peering contacts.

## In Peering Manager

Inside Peering Manager, a contact role is defined by three properties:

* `Name`: a name for the role.
* `Slug`: a URL or configuration friendly version of the role's name.
* `Description`: a short text explaining what the role stands for.
