# Tags

Tags are text labels which can be applied to objects. Each tag has a label and
a URL-friendly slug. The slug is generated automatically and makes tags easier
to work with as URL parameters. Objects can be filtered by tags.

For each tag that you create, the following properties can be configured (n.b.
some are optional):

* `Name`: human-readable name attached to a tag.
* `Slug`: unique configuration and URL-friendly name. Usually automatically
  generated from the tag's name
* `Color`: RGB color code that will be used when displaying the tag in the
  user interface.
* `Comments`: text to explain what the tag is for. Can use Markdown
  formatting.
