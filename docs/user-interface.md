# User Interface

Beginning to use a new tool can be difficult without knowing your way around
the user interface. While Peering Manager aims to have the most straight
forward interface for you to do what you need to.

## Homepage And Navigation

The homepage gathers a set of useful information to quickly provide insights
about the state of various objects (BGP sessions, IXPs, routers, and more).

With the sidebar's help, you can switch between categories and reach pages
displaying lists of objects. Most of these lists can be sorted and their
columns can also be organized as the users feel. Note that column setup and
pagination count are individual of a user.

Each item of a list can be clicked (on the highlighted value) so you can see
specific details about the it. If an item has a relationship with another one,
you should also be able to click of the relationship to get the related item.

## User Profile

To get to the user profile, you can click on the far right of the navigation
bar. A menu will open and you'll be able to click on the __Profile__ item.

Clicking the item will get you to a page with four tabs in which you'll be
able to review your account's details, your preferences, change your password
(if you are using the built-in authentication) and manage your API tokens.
