### New Features

#### API Breaking Changes

* The `JobResult` model has been moved from the extras app to core and renamed to `Job`. Accordingly, its REST API endpoint has been moved from `/api/extras/job-results/` to `/api/core/jobs/`
* The `obj_type` field on the `Job` model (previously `JobResult`) has been renamed to `object_type` for consistency
* The `JOBRESULT_RETENTION` configuration parameter has been renamed to `JOB_RETENTION`
* The URLs for the REST API schema documentation have changed:
  * `/api/docs/` is now `/api/schema/swagger-ui/`
  * `/api/redoc/` is now `/api/schema/redoc/`
* The `Tag` model has been moved from the utils app to extras. Accordingly, its REST API endpoint has been moved from `/api/utils/tags/` to `/api/extras/tags/`
* The `ObjectChange` model has been moved from the utils app to extras. Accordingly, its REST API endpoint has been moved from `/api/utils/object-changes/` to `/api/extras/object-changes/`
* The `CACHE_TIMEOUT` configuration parameter has been removed

#### API Code General Housekeeping

A lot of efforts has been put in making the global code base more maintainable and future proof. This shouldn't have impact on using Peering Manager in general. However it brings some changes to users as well by improving API schema.

Also changing the selected affiliated AS via API as seen its dedicated endpoint removed. It is still possible to change it but users must now use the user preferences endpoint at `/api/users/userpref/`.

This global code refactoring is also the reason of the above mentioned API breaking changes and the below mentioned models normalisation.

#### Models Normalisation

Models have been normalised using common classes and now inherit automatically some fields. This means that some fields (`name`, `slug`, `description`) have been added to some models.

All `name` fields have been limited to 100 characters as well as the `slug` fields. If values in these fields exceed the 100 characters limit, you'll need to adjust them prior to the upgrade.

#### Move IX-API Code To `pyixapi`

Fields has been added to store IX-API tokens and their respective expiration times. The use of `pyixapi` allows cleaner code and better maintainability. Data retrieval has been improved and is now faster by fetching all data instead of doing multiple calls to IX-API instances with filtering. Data correlation is done in memory but it should not explode in RAM as data amount is relatively small.

#### IP Prefix Lookup Default Settings ([#735](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/745))

To lookup prefixes, the default settings used to include a long list of IRR sources, some of them being less relevant as of today (year 2023). This list has been reduce to include only authoritative sources as the default. This means that it now includes:

* RIPE
* ARIN
* APNIC
* AFRINIC
* LACNIC
* RPKI, a pseudo source used by IRRd v4 servers

The default host for prefix lookup has been changed to use NTT's which is located at `rr.ntt.net`.

These changes are made in an attempt to follow Internet best pratices in term of IRR trust by deprecating non-authoritative sources.

#### Webhook Framework Improvements ([#719](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/719))

The webhook framework has been extended to allow more flexibility and less triggers.

Webhooks can now be created as regular objects, without the use of the admin panel. They can be found in the "Other" menu of the sidebar and in the `/api/extras/webhooks/` API endpoint.

Also webhooks are now attached to content types which mean they can be triggered only for selected object types. Additional headers can be added, the body of the webhook can be changed using templating and Jinja2. Conditions can be defined to fire a webhook only if some terms are met.

Reviewing the webhook model documentation is highly encouraged to get to know more about it.

#### Status For Sessions, Group And Devices ([#735](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/735))

It has been raised several times that there were not enough statuses to fit users workflows. Several statuses have been added to address this issue.

Pre and post maintenance statuses for BGP groups, IXPs and devices have been included to better reflect maintenance work and allow according workflow.

BGP sessions have 6 more possible statuses to reflect the life cycle of a session from
requested to decommissioned. Possible statuses are now: requested, provisioning, enabled, pre-maintenance, maintenance, post-maintenance, disabled, decommissioning, and decommissioned.
