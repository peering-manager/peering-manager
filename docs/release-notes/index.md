# Release Notes

Peering Manager releases are numbered as major, minor, and patch releases. For
example, version `1.8.0` is a minor release, and `1.8.3` is a patch release.
Briefly, these can be described as follows:

* **Major** - Introduces or removes an entire API or other core functionality
* **Minor** - Implements major new features but may include breaking changes
  for API consumers or other integrations
* **Patch** - A maintenance release which fixes bugs and may introduce
  backward-compatible enhancements

Minor releases are published when developers feel that enough new features
and/or important changes have been added to the code base. Patch releases are
published as needed to address bugs and fulfill minor feature requests.
