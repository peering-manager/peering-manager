# Web Server Setup

We will set up a simple WSGI frontend using **gunicorn** and **supervisord**
for service persistence. As web server we will use Apache 2. You can of course
use whatever combination of tool that you want.

# Apache 2

Install the Apache 2 package and enable mod proxy.
```no-highlight
# apt install apache2
# a2enmod proxy
# a2enmod proxy_http
```

Now we will add a new virtual host that will be used to setup the proxy to the
gunicorn server. We will create and edit the following file
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/peering-manager.conf`.

The content of the file can be something like this.
```no-highlight
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ServerName peering.example.com
  Alias /static /opt/peering-manager/static

  <Directory /opt/peering-manager/static>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  <Location /static>
    ProxyPass !
  </Location>

  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8001/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8001/
</VirtualHost>
```

Remove the default virtual host and enable the new one.
```no-highlight
# a2dissite 000-default.conf
# a2ensite peering-manager.conf
```

Restart Apache 2 to eanble our new configuration and mods.
```no-highlight
# systemctl restart apache2
```

To avoid any issues with read/write permission, set the Apache 2 user as owner
of the Peering Manager directory.
```no-highlight
# chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/peering-manager
```


## gunicorn

Install **gunicorn** using **pip**.
```no-highlight
# pip3 install gunicorn
```
Save the following configuration in the root of the Peering Manager
installation path as `gunicorn_config.py`. Be sure to verify the location of
the **gunicorn** executable on your server (e.g. which gunicorn) and to update
the pythonpath variable if needed.
```no-highlight
command = '/usr/local/bin/gunicorn'
pythonpath = '/opt/peering-manager'
bind = '127.0.0.1:8001'
workers = 4
user = 'www-data'
```

We can test if the configuration is correct by running (note the _ instead of -
in the WSGI name):
```no-highlight
# gunicorn -c /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn_config.py peering_manager.wsgi
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.7.1
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8001 (7214)
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7217] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7217
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7219] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7219
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7220] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7220
[2017-09-27 22:49:03 +0200] [7222] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7222
```

## supervisord

Install **supervisord**.
```no-highlight
# apt install supervisor
```

Create a configuration file `/etc/supervisor/conf.d/peering-manager.conf` and
set its content.
```no-highlight
[program:peering-manager]
directory = /opt/peering-manager/
command = gunicorn -c /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn_config.py peering_manager.wsgi
user = www-data
```

Restart **supervisord** to load the configuration.
```no-highlight
# systemctl restart supervisor
```

At this point, you should be able to connect to the Apache 2 HTTP service at
the server name or IP address you provided. If you receive a 502 (bad gateway)
error, this indicates that **gunicorn** is misconfigured or not running.
