# Web Server Setup

We will set up a simple WSGI frontend using **gunicorn** and **systemd** for
service persistence. As web server we will use Apache 2. You can of course use
whatever combination of tool that you want.

## Apache 2

Install the Apache 2 package and enable mod proxy.
```no-highlight
# apt install apache2
# a2enmod headers
# a2enmod proxy
# a2enmod proxy_http
```

Now we will add a new virtual host that will be used to setup the proxy to the
gunicorn server. We will create and edit the following file
`/etc/apache2/sites-available/peering-manager.conf`.

The content of the file can be something like this.
```no-highlight
<VirtualHost *:80>
  ProxyPreserveHost On
  ServerName peering.example.com
  Alias /static /opt/peering-manager/static

  <Directory /opt/peering-manager/static>
    Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
    AllowOverride None
    Require all granted
  </Directory>

  <Location /static>
    ProxyPass !
  </Location>

  RequestHeader set "X-Forwarded-Proto" expr=%{REQUEST_SCHEME}
  ProxyPass / http://127.0.0.1:8001/
  ProxyPassReverse / http://127.0.0.1:8001/
</VirtualHost>
```

Remove the default virtual host and enable the new one.
```no-highlight
# a2dissite 000-default.conf
# a2ensite peering-manager.conf
```

Restart Apache 2 to eanble our new configuration and mods.
```no-highlight
# systemctl restart apache2
```

To avoid any issues with read/write permission, set the Apache 2 user as owner
of the Peering Manager directory.
```no-highlight
# chown -R www-data:www-data /opt/peering-manager
```

## gunicorn

Install **gunicorn** using **pip** inside the Python virtual environment.
```no-highlight
(venv) # pip3 install gunicorn
```

Save the following configuration in the root of the Peering Manager
installation path as `gunicorn.py`. Be sure to verify the location of the
**gunicorn** executable on your server (e.g. `which gunicorn`) and to update
the pythonpath variable if needed. Note that some tasks such as importing
existing peering sessions or generating prefix lists can take a lot of time to
complete so setting a timeout greater than 30 seconds can be helpful.
```no-highlight
command = '/usr/local/bin/gunicorn'
pythonpath = '/opt/peering-manager'
bind = '127.0.0.1:8001'
workers = 5
threads = 3
timeout = 300
max_requests = 5000
max_requests_jitter = 500
user = 'peering-manager'
```

We can test if the configuration is correct by running (note the _ instead of -
in the WSGI name):
```no-highlight
(venv) # ./venv/bin/gunicorn -c /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn_config.py peering_manager.wsgi
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.7.1
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8001 (7214)
[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Using worker: sync

[2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7219] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7219

[2017-09-27 22:49:03 +0200] [7222] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7222
```

## systemd

Create a service file `/etc/systemd/system/peering-manager.service` and
set its content.
```no-highlight
[Unit]
Description=Peering Manager WSGI Service
Documentation=https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple

User=peering-manager
Group=peering-manager
PIDFile=/var/tmp/peering-manager.pid
WorkingDirectory=/opt/peering-manager

ExecStart=/opt/peering-manager/venv/bin/gunicorn --pid /var/tmp/peering-manager.pid --pythonpath /opt/peering-manager --config /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn.py peering-manager.wsgi

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Create another service file `/etc/systemd/system/peering-manager-rq.service`
and set its content.
```no-highlight
[Unit]
Description=Peering Manager Request Queue Worker
Documentation=https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple

User=peering-manager
Group=peering-manager
WorkingDirectory=/opt/peering-manager

ExecStart=/opt/peering-manager/venv/bin/python3 /opt/peering-manager/manage.py rqworker

Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=30
PrivateTmp=true

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Reload **systemd** to load the services, start them and enable them at boot
time.
```no-highlight
# systemctl daemon-reload
# systemctl start peering-manager
# systemctl enable peering-manager
# systemctl start peering-manager-rq
# systemctl enable peering-manager-rq
```

You can use the `systemctl status peering-manager` and
`systemctl status peering-manager-rq` to verify that the WSGI service and the
request queue worker service are respectively running.

At this point, you should be able to connect to the Apache 2 HTTP service at
the server name or IP address you provided. If you receive a 502 (bad gateway)
error, this indicates that **gunicorn** is misconfigured or not running.
