# Setup the Peering Manager codebase

## Operating System Setup

First we need a proper text editor, Git and Python. We will use Git to get the
code, and Python to run it. Peering Manager is mostly tested with Python
version 3 (3.8 minimum) so we will setup the machine with this version.

!!! attention
    Note that your favourite distribution may not have Python's required
    version packaged. In that case, the following commands are applicable.
    Possible solutions are: using additional package repositories or
    different packages like `python38` instead of `python3`.

=== "Debian 11 / 12"
    ```no-highlight
    # apt install python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip git vim
    ```

=== "CentOS 7 & 8"
    ```no-highlight
    # yum install python3 git
    ```

Select a base directory for the peering-manager installation.  ie: `/opt`

```no-highlight
# cd /opt
```

Clone the Git repository from the base directory.  This will create the
`peering-manager` application directory and extract the repository into it.

```no-highlight
# git clone https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager.git
Cloning into 'peering-manager'...

Resolving deltas: 100% (5135/5135), done.
```

Verify the repository was extracted.

```no-highlight

```

You can see all releases by running `git tag`, then check out the release by
running `git checkout versionWanted`.

!!! info "Development version"
    If you are feeling adventurous, you can skip this step and stay on main,
    the bleeding edge of development. But beware, things may break.

## Create the Peering Manager User

Create a system user account named `peering-manager`. It'll be used by the WSGI
and HTTP services to run under this account.

```no-highlight
# groupadd --system peering-manager
# useradd --system --gid peering-manager peering-manager
# chown --recursive peering-manager /opt/peering-manager
```

## Set Up Python Environment

First create a Python
[virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3.8/tutorial/venv.html) to ensure
Peering Manager's required packages don't conflict with anything in the system.
This will create a directory named `venv` in the Peering Manager root
directory.

```no-highlight
# python3 -m venv /opt/peering-manager/venv
```

Activate the virtual environment and install the required Python packages.

```no-highlight
# source venv/bin/activate
(venv) # pip3 install --upgrade pip
(venv) # pip3 install -r requirements.txt
...
Installing collected packages: ...
```

Note: If your deployment requires any non-core Python packages (such as
gunicorn, uwsgi, or django-auth-ldap), list them in a file named
`local_requirements.txt` in the Peering Manager root directory (alongside
`requirements.txt`). This will ensure they are detected and re-installed by
the upgrade script when the Python virtual environment is rebuilt.

## Peering Manager Initial Configuration

After completing requirements installation we can now setup Peering Manager.
A configuration file is needed and can be copied from the included example
file.

```no-highlight
# cp peering_manager/configuration.example.py peering_manager/configuration.py
```

Modify `configuration.py` according to your requirements.

```python
# allow any hosts
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']

# key that must be unique to each install
SECRET_KEY = 'comeonebabylightmyfire'

# base URL path if accessing Peering Manager within a directory.
BASE_PATH = ''

# time zone to use for date.
TIME_ZONE = 'Europe/Paris'

# PostgreSQL database configuration
DATABASE = {
    "NAME": "peering_manager",  # Database name
    "USER": "peering_manager",  # PostgreSQL username
    "PASSWORD": "DoNotUseMe",  # PostgreSQL password
    "HOST": "localhost",  # Database server
    "PORT": "",  # Database port (leave blank for default)
}

# Redis configuration
REDIS = {
    'tasks': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'CACHE_DATABASE': 0,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    },
    'caching': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    }
}
```

## Database Migrations

Before Peering Manager can run, we need to install the database schema.

```no-highlight
(venv) # python3 manage.py migrate
Operations to perform:
  Apply all migrations: admin, auth, contenttypes, peering, sessions, utils
Running migrations:
  Applying contenttypes.0001_initial... OK
  Applying auth.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0001_initial... OK
  Applying admin.0002_logentry_remove_auto_add... OK
  Applying contenttypes.0002_remove_content_type_name... OK
  Applying auth.0002_alter_permission_name_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0003_alter_user_email_max_length... OK
  Applying auth.0004_alter_user_username_opts... OK
  Applying auth.0005_alter_user_last_login_null... OK
  Applying auth.0006_require_contenttypes_0002... OK
  Applying auth.0007_alter_validators_add_error_messages... OK
  Applying auth.0008_alter_user_username_max_length... OK
  ...
```

## Create a Super User

A superuser is required to log into Peering Manager and start its
administration (eg. creating other user accounts).

```no-highlight
(venv) # python3 manage.py createsuperuser
Username (leave blank to use 'root'): admin
Email address: somename@example.com
Password:
Password (again):
Superuser created successfully.
```

## Collect Static Files

```no-highlight
(venv) # python3 manage.py collectstatic --no-input
...
293 static files copied to '/opt/peering-manager/static'.
```

## Test the Application

And now we can start testing the setup.

```no-highlight
(venv) # python3 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --insecure
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).

Django version 4.0.4, using settings 'peering_manager.settings'
Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/
Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```

## Set up application server

Before we can deliver Peering Manager with our web server of choice, we have
to set up the application server.

=== "gunicorn"
    Install **gunicorn** using **pip** inside the Python virtual environment.
    ```no-highlight
    (venv) # echo 'gunicorn' >> local_requirements.txt
    (venv) # pip3 install -r local_requirements.txt
    ```

    Save the following configuration in the root of the Peering Manager
    installation path as `gunicorn.py`. Be sure to verify the location of the
    **gunicorn** executable on your server (e.g. `which gunicorn`) and to update
    the pythonpath variable if needed. Note that some tasks such as importing
    existing peering sessions or generating prefix lists can take a lot of time to
    complete so setting a timeout greater than 30 seconds can be helpful.

    !!! info "IPv6"
        Replace `http://127.0.0.1:8001` with `http://[::1]:8001` if you have
        configured gunicorn to listen on the IPv6 loopback address.

    ```no-highlight
    bind = '127.0.0.1:8001'
    workers = 5
    threads = 3
    timeout = 300
    max_requests = 5000
    max_requests_jitter = 500
    user = 'peering-manager'
    ```

    We can test if the configuration is correct by running (note the _ instead of -
    in the WSGI name):
    ```no-highlight
    (venv) # ./venv/bin/gunicorn -c /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn.py peering_manager.wsgi
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 19.7.1
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Listening at: http://127.0.0.1:8001 (7214)
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7214] [INFO] Using worker: sync
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7217] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7217
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7219] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7219
    [2017-09-27 22:49:02 +0200] [7220] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7220
    [2017-09-27 22:49:03 +0200] [7222] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7222
    ```

    Create a service file `/etc/systemd/system/peering-manager.service` and
    set its content.
    ```no-highlight
    [Unit]
    Description=Peering Manager WSGI Service
    Documentation=https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=peering-manager
    Group=peering-manager
    PIDFile=/var/tmp/peering-manager.pid
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/peering-manager

    ExecStart=/opt/peering-manager/venv/bin/gunicorn --pid /var/tmp/peering-manager.pid --pythonpath /opt/peering-manager --config /opt/peering-manager/gunicorn.py peering_manager.wsgi

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=30
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Create another service file `/etc/systemd/system/peering-manager-rqworker@.service`
    and set its content.
    ```no-highlight
    [Unit]
    Description=Peering Manager Request Queue Worker
    Documentation=https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/
    After=network-online.target
    Wants=network-online.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=peering-manager
    Group=peering-manager
    WorkingDirectory=/opt/peering-manager

    ExecStart=/opt/peering-manager/venv/bin/python3 /opt/peering-manager/manage.py rqworker

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=30
    PrivateTmp=true

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    Reload **systemd** to load the services, start them and enable them at boot
    time.
    ```no-highlight
    # systemctl daemon-reload
    # systemctl enable peering-manager --now
    # systemctl enable peering-manager-rqworker@1 --now
    ```

    You can use the `systemctl status peering-manager` and
    `systemctl status peering-manager-rqworker@1` to verify that the WSGI service and the
    request queue worker service are respectively running.

    !!! attention
        The rqworker unit is prepared to run multiple worker instances but the documentation
        only explains it with one unit to make it easier to read. If you want, you can start more
        units by replacing the 1 after the @ with something else, it can also be a string. So you
        could have `peering-manager-rqworker@something` or similar.

=== "uWSGI"
    As an alternative to gunicorn, you can also use [uWSGI](https://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/)
    as application server. It is now a maintenance mode only project.

    Please see the [uWSGI extra page](uwsgi.md) for further details.
