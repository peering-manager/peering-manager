# What is Peering Manager?

Peering Manager is an open source web application designed to help manager and
document peering networks and peering sessions. It is not a tool that aims to
replace the great [PeeringDB](https://peeringdb.com).

# Application Stack

Peering Manager is built on the [Django](https://djangoproject.com/) Python
framework. It runs as a WSGI service behind your choice of HTTP server.

| Function     | Component             |
|--------------|-----------------------|
| HTTP Service | Apache 2 or nginx     |
| WSGI Service | gunicorn or uWSGI     |
| Application  | Django/Python         |
| Database     | PostgreSQL            |
