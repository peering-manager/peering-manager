Peering Manager is a BGP session management tool. Initially conceived as a way
to document Internet Exchanges points and peering sessions, its goal is now to
provide a source of truth and configuration management for external BGP
sessions of all kind (transit, customers, peering, â€¦).

The complete documentation for Peering Manager can be found at
[Read the Docs](https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/). A public demo
instance is available at https://demo.peering-manager.net/.
