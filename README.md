# Peering Manager

When you start to peer a lot on different Internet exchange points, managing
all your sessions can be time consuming.

In order to make peering management less difficult, it needs to be organized
and documented. This is the goal of this project.

The idea is to document every Internet exchange points that you are connected
to and every autonomous systems that you are peering with.
