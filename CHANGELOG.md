## Version 1.3.0 | MARK I (Features release) | 2020-12-22

Take this release as little early Christmas gift. There will be some rough edges to be fixed in bug fixes releases. Please take some time to read the changelog, breaking changes are there.

### New Features

#### Support Fo Multiple Affiliated Autonomous Systems

This feature has been sponsored by [CIRA - The Canadian Internet Registration Authority](https://www.cira.ca/). Big thanks to them for bringing it to the community.

As of this release users will now be able to manage more than one autonomous systems as their own within a single Peering Manager instance as described in [issue #288](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/288).

This feature is a big one as it brings some breaking changes to the way users used to define their own autonomous system. Until now a `MY_ASN` setting was required. This setting is dropped in this release but do **not** delete it yet. It will be used for migration purposes while moving from an older release to this one.

After configuring Peering Manager, users have to create at least one autonomous system, their own, and check the new `Affiliated` field to mark the AS. More than one autonomous systems can be marked as affiliated. A dropdown menu will then appear next to the user profile menu so they can select which AS they are working on. This choice is done per-user so two different users can work on two different autonomous systems at the same time. The dropdown menu can also be used to perform a quick switch of context. The last choice will be remembered for later use.

Internet Exchanges, routers and direct peering sessions are linked to a local autonomous system. It means that these objects are "owned" by the local AS. When migrating from a previous version, users' AS will be automatically created and existing objects will be linked to it.

To conclude on this feature, users will need to review their templates due to variable changes.

#### PeeringDB Interaction

To support new features and fix some serious bugs that we tried to manage from one release to the next, the whole code used to fetch data from PeeringDB as been re-written.

During the migration from a previous release, the local PeeringDB cache will be cleared to make a clean slate. Users will need to run `python3 manage.py peeringdb_sync` after upgrading. Be aware that first run can take a lot of time to complete: up to an hour depending on the machine Peering Manager is running on.

This first big refactoring of the codebase does not bring a lot of new features, yet. However, it will fix and bring stability to long lasting issues. It also comes in pair with the new affiliated autonomous systems feature as it required it. If no local synchronization of PeeringDB's data is performed, Peering Manager will assume that PeeringDB is not supposed to be used as data source. This change is intentional and will stay as is. If a local copy of PeeringDB data is found, Internet Exchanges will be automatically linked to their corresponding PeeringDB records when a user will load each IX views. These links between Peering Manager and PeeringDB data cannot be overridden and will be set to `NULL` in the database if PeeringDB's data is deleted during a synchronization. Missing peering sessions will still be detected but dynamically, it can take some time but the result will be cached into Redis. The `check_for_ix_peering_sessions` command has been therefore removed. Users will see a regression in the AS list as the icon showing missing sessions has been removed. This is intended due to performance issue and it might come back in another release.

## Version 1.2.0 | MARK I (Features release) | 2020-08-08

Peering Manager is now available in a [dedicated organization](https://github.com/peering-manager).

### New Features

#### RADIUS Authentication

A new RADIUS based authentication backend is now available. It uses the `django-radius` module and requires to create a `radius_config.py` file inside the `peering_manager` directory. Contributed by @mngan.

#### Preview Templates

Configuration and e-mails templates can now be previewed by a click on a single button. This feature is particularly useful when creating templates for the first time as it allows to see if the results match expected ones. If a syntax error occurs during the rendering process, the error message will be displayed to the user for fixing.

#### Caching, Background Tasks And Webhooks

Redis is used a caching technology. This feature can help reducing latencies inside Peering Manager by caching the results of SQL queries which could be executed more than once on the same set of data. Putting the results in Redis will avoid having to run the queries again thus reducing database stress. The new setting `CACHE_TIMEOUT` controls the number of seconds for which the results are kept in cache. A 0 value disables the caching process. The cache is also use to cache whole router configurations to avoid going through the template rendering process that can be quite time consuming for large configurations. A configuration cache value is automatically invalidated if the router is it attached to is changed and/or if the template is changed as well.

Redis is also used as background task scheduling mechanism. The primary use of this feature is sending webhooks when objects are changed inside Peering Manager. A webhook is a request sent to a HTTP(S) endpoint with a payload that includes data about an object and its changes. It can be useful for Peering Manager to notify other tools about what it does. It has been accepted as a solution to [#184](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/184). Webhooks can be created using the administration interface. The same interface can also be used to see background tasks and their states.

The use of Redis is mandatory as of this version and requires a change of configuration. If Redis is installed on the same machine alongside Peering Manager, the following configuration is enough to get it working.

```python
REDIS = {
    'tasks': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'CACHE_DATABASE': 0,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    },
    'caching': {
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': 6379,
        'PASSWORD': '',
        'CACHE_DATABASE': 1,
        'DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300,
        'SSL': False,
    }
}
```

#### [#199](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/199) User Preferences

Introduce a model for storing per-user preferences. This feature is now used to keep pagination and table columns preferences. Users can delete recorded preferences using the dedicated tab inside their profiles.

#### [#211](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/211) Table Columns Preferences

Add user interface elements to toggle and reorder table columns for list views. Each column order is stored as a JSON value in user's preferences. Default columns have been assigned to tables.

The peering session state column has been split into 3 different columns:

* actual state,
* received routes value, and,
* advertised routes value.

This helps to sort sessions based on route metrics and state.

### Configuration And E-mail Refactoring

Two new types of object called `Configuration` and `Email` are available to manage templates dedicated to configurations and e-mails differently. When migrating, foreign keys used to link templates to routers will be preserved.

Leveraging the new `Email` object, the `subject` field has been added to allow users to customize e-mail subjects with the same templating capabilities that are available for the e-mail bodies.

## Version 1.1.0 | MARK I (Features release) | 2019-12-08

### New Features

#### E-mailing

Autonomous System contacts can be synchronized from PeeringDB to use them as recipients for e-mails. Some PeeringDB contacts are hidden and cannot be synchronized if the `PEERINGDB_USERNAME` and `PEERINGDB_PASSWORD` are not set in the configuration. For all contacts to be synchronized, clearing the cache then re-synchronizing with PeeringDB is required.

[//]: # (The links in the next line are broken.)
When a contact is available for an Autonomous System a `Send E-mail` tab will be available from the AS view. An e-mail template has to be selected along with a contact to send the e-mail to. E-mail templates can be written following [this section](https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates/#e-mail) of the documentation. An example is also [available](https://peering-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/templates/peering-request-email/).

### Enhancements

* [#191](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/issues/191) - Bulk edit, bulk delete Internet Exchange peering sessions fromAutonomous System view
