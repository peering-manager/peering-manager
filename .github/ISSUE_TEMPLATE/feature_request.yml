        work on the details of a proposed new feature, please start a
        [discussion](https://github.com/peering-manager/peering-manager/discussions)

      description: >
        Note any changes to the database schema necessary to support the new
        feature. For example, does the proposal require adding a new model or

      description: >
        List any new dependencies on external libraries or services that this
        new feature would introduce. For example, does the proposal require
        the installation of a new Python package? Please keep in mind that we
        do not want to add to many extra dependencies.
        (Not all new features introduce new dependencies.)
